The IRSS lab has access to a lab vehicle known as the “Lab Truck”. This vehicle is a Nissan Xterra 4 wheel drive which is available for students to use for field work. Within the lab we have a designated lab truck manager who is responsible for the maintenance and the booking of the vehicle. If you require the use of the vehicle for your field work, contact the lab manager to book the vehicle for your field work times. After each use of the lab truck you must log your kilometers using the [Lab Truck Submission Form](https://forms.gle/VicwE4dYmaJWiyc27)

The vehicle itself is owned and managed by UBC. Gas can be put in the vehicle using the **gas VISA card** which remains in the glove box compartment. You can only use the gas VISA card at registered service stations or gas stations. You cannot buy gas from non service stations e.g. 7/11.

**You must always keep the receipt for the gas as it needs to be reconciled against the visa statement each month. Please return the gas card and the receipt to the envelope in the glove box.**

The lab truck must always be used for UBC business. The mileage on the lab truck is calculated each month and the respective research accounts for our projects are then billed by the mileage which is undertaken. There are two sets of keys for the lab truck, both in the printer room (located in FSC room 2231). Please ensure you only take one set of keys when using the vehicle. The pass to open the UBC parking garage gate is in the truck in the center console between the two seats attached to a pizza menu. **Always leave the pass in the truck.**

## Parking {-#parking}

The vehicle can be parked in two locations. There is a designated spot for the vehicle in the forestry basement parkade (labeled IRSS). In addition it is possible to park the vehicle at UBC Thunderbird parkade in the designated spot (_R224 on the ground floor_). If the vehicle is parked anywhere else at UBC, it will incur a parking fine which the person driving the car at the time must pay.

## In case of an accident {-#accident}

If you get into an accident while using the vehicle, the registration papers for the vehicle are in the glove box. You are fully insured as a UBC student to drive the vehicle so you can provide your name and address, Nicholas' name and phone number, and vehicle registration information to any police or other people involved in the accident. You should let Nicholas know immediately, regardless of the time of day, and UBC will then become involved with ICBC.

## Returning from field work {-#vehiclefield}

You should always leave the truck as you found it (or cleaner)!

Upon returning from any field work you should discuss the condition of the vehicle with the lab truck manager. If the vehicle has had or requires servicing (e.g. warning lights have gone on the dashboard), please immediately tell the lab track manager so we can ensure it gets serviced in a timely manner. If you returned from field work late, you are able to park the lab truck at home and bring it back to UBC the next day. The truck can be used in exceptional circumstances on the weekend, for example to help with moving or purchasing of lab supplies.

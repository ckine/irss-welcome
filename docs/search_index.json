Its a pleasure to welcome you into the lab and Im very much looking forward to working with you on the project that you have come here to do, and have a fun filled and rich learning environment. While you are here for your project, being a graduate student as you Im sure realize, is very different than being an undergraduate. In the IRSS lab we have a very flat structure with post-docs, PhDs, Masters, and work learn students all treated similarly. Collaboration is strongly encouraged in the lab, so be sure to use the resources available to you and ask your fellow students questions when you have them. Equity, inclusion, and diversity The IRSS is situated on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the hnqminm speaking xmkym (Musqueam) people. We also recognize that wherever we work, we do so on lands with traditional and ancestral heritage. We are fortunate to be a part of a diverse community at UBC. People come from near and far to share their own culture and knowledge. We welcome diversity within the Integrated Remote Sensing Studio. People of varying race, nationality, gender identification, sexual orientation, beliefs, age, disability status, and discipline make us stronger as a group and more compassionate and inclusive human beings. We recognize that we all work differently, and that we all have valuable ideas to contribute. We understand that working together is more fun and creative than working alone. We recognize a wide range of successes and that success for one is an achievement for all. Figure 2: The Indigenous Strategic Plan: An Overview - CC BY SA 4.0 The Faculty of Forestry has released values statements that we fully endorse. We are proponents of involvement in initiatives like the Forestry Diversity Crew and encourage students and staff (new and old) to get involved. We also encourage anyone to access and familiarize themselves with UBC resources related to equity, inclusion, and diversity. Expectations As a graduate student I expect you to be fully self driven and able to remain motivated and enthusiastic throughout your time here at UBC. I imagine at times you will feel incredibly stressed and there will be times that you feel like walking away. Im also sure there will be hopefully more times when you leave after a days work full of enthusiasm and excitement to come back and continue the work tomorrow. The process of undertaking research and collaborating with others is a fantastically enjoyable experience but one that is not without detours, U-turns, and hiccups. I appreciate that when you begin your project youll be overwhelmed by the size of a lab, the diversity of the projects that people are working on, and the wide background of the people and colleagues around you. I imagine you may also feel like you dont deserve to belong here with many of the other students in the lab at the top of their game with respect to research, writing, and coding. Within a few months however, I hope that as you make friendships and learn about what people are doing and that you too will realize that you can reach these goals and within a year or so you will feel like you belong intellectually and personally. In your second year new students will come along and you will see that same look of fear in their eyes and youll be able to reassure them too that the initial hesitation of being in the lab will pass. As you feel more comfortable and get to know everyone better, it is my true hope that the friendships that you form will last with you a lifetime, and that as you move through your career once you leave UBC you will stay in touch with past, current and future lab members, and immediately gravitate to each other and build new collaborations and projects. Figure 3: The entrance to the lab. Welcome! "],["intouch.html", "Communication &amp; staying in touch Slack Email", " Communication &amp; staying in touch There are two main forms of communication in the lab: Slack and email. Slack Slack is a popular messaging platform. When you become a lab member youll receive an invitation to the IRSS Slack channel. Follow-up with Nicholas if you havent yet. The IRSS slack portal ID is ubc-irss.slack.com IRSS Slack contains several channels, each serving different purposes. The most important channels are: #general - For general discussion on various topics. #ncc_annouce - For important announcements, typically only Nicholas will post in this channel. #science - Anything science related, can be an interesting paper or a coding issue someone is struggling with. #irss-supp-grp - Lab support group. A place to anonymously share ideas of how to improve the lab, talk about issues not related to your research, or ask for help. Important to note that Nicholas is not a member of this channel. Youll quickly notice that the conversations on slack (especially on #general) are often very relaxed. However, remember that all public channels are PG13. Email Nicholass primary email is nicholas.coops@ubc.ca. He generally tries to respond to emails as quickly as possible, but if he hasnt replied to you in 2 days, send him a reminder. His emails can often be short and direct, he sends alot of them daily! "],["computers.html", "Computer related information Software Your laptop Backing up your files Setting up a shared drive Connecting from home Connecting to printers Backing up your data", " Computer related information Your workstation is a state-of-the-art, powerful, server-grade computer, with two processors, 16 to 24 cores, 64GB of RAM, and a professional graphics card for accelerating 3D computations. It will come with some software pre-installed (e.g. MS Office), however, based on your project you may request additional software to be installed. Figure 4: What your workstation will look like. Credit: Dell Software UBC has license for the following software packages: ArcMap, ArcGIS Pro Envi+IDL eCognition Adobe suite, including Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign etc. You can also install some software packages yourself, as long as they are free or the license is available. Some of the most useful software packages we use in the lab currently include: R + RStudio LAStools (point cloud data processing, license available) CloudCompare (for viewing ALS/DAP point clouds)) SnagIt - Navigate to teaching and learning software Camtasia - Navigate to teaching and learning software Microsoft PowerToys is a set of utilities (developed by Microsoft) designed to improve the user experience on Windows 10. It has a few key functionalites that are incredibly useful in the lab, namely Fancy Zones and Color Picker. The Fancy Zones plugin allows you to set zones on your screen outside of the standard two that Windows provides. The large screens in the lab make this a very useful function, as you can easily snap multiple windows to portions of your screen. To do this drag a window while holding Shift. The Color Picker allows you to effectively use the dropper from image editing programs anywhere on your computer by pressing Win + Shift + C. Figure 5: The lab and its many work stations IT questions or contact needs If you have some questions about your computer reach out to Nicholas first. The IRSS has a dedicated departmental IT person named Felix Choi. If you need things installed or have hardware questions email him at felix.choi@ubc.ca. Your laptop You will receive a laptop that is for your personal use throughout the length of your graduate studies. Please remember that similar to workstations, laptops are also tracked by UBC. If you are unsure about installing a program, please make sure to ask Nicholas before installation. The same responsibilities apply to use of your laptop as the workstation. Figure 6: Your laptop. Credit: Dell If you are a TA and using the laptop for grading or have any TA material on there, it MUST be encrypted, which is performed by your IT contact. If your laptop was set up by UBC It, it is automatically encrypted. Backing up your files It is crucial that you install and set up a data backup software on your computer(s). There has been numerous hard drive failures in the lab before, and you should always be prepared that the hard drive in your computer can stop working at any moment. Nicholas will pay for SYNC (4TB) if desired and provide a portable hard drive for local backups. To automate backups you can use software like Cobian Backup. Schedule your backups to be incremental and run them daily. Setting up a shared drive IRSS has access to a file server, which is divided into two main folders. ByProject &amp; ByUser ByProject contains datasets related to research projects; ByUser is a space for each lab member to share data with others. These two folders can be accessed from any computer in the lab and should be mapped for easier access. Its important that you do not use IRSS shared drives as your file backup folder as storage space on these drives is limited. To map these drives to your machine do the following: Open File Explorer &gt; right-click on This PC (found in left side list) &gt; click map network drive Choose a letter (e.g. Z) and paste the following \\\\FRST-IRSStor\\Root\\ByProject Repeat this process and assign a different letter (e.g. Y) to the second network folder: \\\\FRST-IRSStor\\Root\\ByUser Connecting from home Figure 7: Remote desktop prompt window. In the lab we can use the Windows Remote Desktop Connection tool to connect to our machines when we are away from the lab. In order to connect to the your lab machine, there are a few steps that need to be followed. Connect to a VPN. On your work laptop, you should have Cisco Anyconnect installed, but it can also be downloaded from http://myvpn.ubc.ca/. To log in, use your CWL. Open the Remote Desktop Connection and enter your computers name as follows: frst-frm-22XYZ.ead.ubc.ca, where XYZ are the digits/letter unique to your desktop (There will be a sticker on the top of your computer tower with these details). Click connect. You will be prompted to enter your CWL again. Alternatively, you can run the following command: mstsc /v frst-frm-22XYZ.ead.ubc.ca, and enter your CWL when promoted. You have now successfully remoted in! Note: it is possible edit the display settings to stretch over 2 screens if you wish. You can also use the minimize button if you are also working on your laptop at the same time, this will not end your remote session. Connecting to printers The IRSS has both a black and white and colour printer available for use. In order to gain access to them follow these steps: Install the HP Driver Open Control Panel then go under Devices and Printers and click Add a printer. Click The printer that I want isn't listed. Select Add a printer using TCP/IP address of hostname then click Next. Insert IP address of the printer (see IPs below). Append the Port name as shown then click Next. HP Color LaserJet E75245 IP: 142.103.230.21 Xerox Phaser 4510 Series Class Driver IP: 142.103.230.20 If a window appears that asks about driver version select Use the driver that is currently installed. Keep the default printer name then click Next. Make sure Do not share this printer is selected then click Next. You should now be connected! Backing up your data Everyone should actively be backing up their data. People have worked hard on projects and lost everything due to hard drive failure. Dont think it wont happen to you - backup your data routinely There are 3 options for data backup: Ask Nicholas for an external hard drive (HDD) to save data on. Ask Nicholas about SYNC and your ability to store data on the cloud. Once you have completed projects (or are done your time at the IRSS) you must backup your data on the data backup server \\\\frst-irsstor\\root\\IRSSbackup. Backing up on the server Prior to dumping data onto the server please read the following steps and adhere to them to avoid loss and limit storage use. Compress your data - Compress individual folders within your directories. Do not make a single, massive, compressed folder! It will likely lead to corruptions in your data and you will lose it all. Instead, compress data into smaller chunks, e.g. divide the data into projects or sub directories. Downloading tools like 7zip makes compressing many folders at once easy. If you have many sub directories you need to compress and do not want to compress them individually make a .bat file with the script below, save it in the folder with your directories, and run it. :: compress all directories and name them the same for /d %%X in (*) do &quot;c:\\Program Files\\7-Zip\\7z.exe&quot; a &quot;%%X.zip&quot; &quot;%%X\\&quot; Copying your data to the backup server - Download TeraCopy and use it to transfer the data to the server. Errors often occur when large amounts of data are transferred over the network. TeraCopy allows you to validate the data transfer after the copying is done. It is important to check the validate option! Validation take a long time (about the same as the transfer) but gives you a piece of mind that everything is ok. Errors will show up and you can then copy those files again. Naming Convention - Please use the naming convention: LastnameFirstname. My name is Tristan Goodbody so my directory within the backup is called GoodbodyTristan. "],["safety.html", "Safety In the lab In the field Fieldwork", " Safety In the lab When you arrive at UBC you are given a safety orientation folder by the department. This safety orientation folder contains a number of forms that need to be completed once youve arrived at UBC. There is a basic form which has your next of kin information, so UBC knows who to contact should that be necessary. This also includes information such as allergies and medical conditions.There is a basic office safety form which covers things like hazards in the office, correct ergonomics which you also can read and complete once youve arrived at UBC you can also talk to Nicholas about your preferred working environment conditions, for example having access to a stand up desk and mat compared to a chair. Within the IRSS lab itself we have two first aid kits: one in each room. Should an evacuation be required from the building the siren will sound and you must immediately evacuate the lab, shutting doors as you leave. The gathering area for the forestry building is on the other side of Agronomy Road to the North of the forestry building itself. In the field Figure 8: Piotr and Doug in New Brunswick. Prior to going out and doing field work for your project you will need to complete a safety plan. This involves filling out specific forms, providing important contact details, and outlining how you will keep yourself and your crew mates safe during your work. Figure 9: Sabrina in an aspen stand. Forms There are a number of forms in relation to field work safety. In the IRSS lab because our field work is so diverse and often different by project, we do not have a universal field work safety form. What we do is prepare individual safety forms for each field trip tailored to the location and type of data being collected. Examples of these field safety sheets are in the orientation folder. As part of a field safety plan you need to provide information on your desired route, mileage, and accommodation including hotel name. You will also need to provide contact information and check-in procedures for how you will contact the lab either through cell phone check in or using the SPOT device (see below for more detail). As part of this safety plan for each individual field work program you should consider what additional safety training is needed. We encourage all lab members to have basic first aid training which UBC will cover. We normally undertake lab training for first aid once per year. Other field work training, for example Bear AWARE might be needed depending on your field work location. It is critical this field work form is completed well in advance before departing into the field and the form is then signed by Nicholas and he maintains a copy whilst the field work is underway. Contact information is also provided on that form for next of kin and other people who may need to be contacted should something happen See examples of forms here: \\\\FRST-IRSStor\\Root\\ByProject\\__LABFORMS\\Safety Communication For safety we have two SPOT communicator units. These are for field work when you are out of cell phone coverage and they allow messages to be sent by satellite to designated users as well as having an SOS and help buttons for immediate police and search and rescue. The people who receive messages from the SPOT unit are set up using the SPOT website which Nicholas has access to. As a result, prior to using the units you need to log on to the website and change the appropriate contact people including their emails and phone numbers. This should be done prior to leaving for field work to ensure that when you check in the messages go to the right people. Please ensure prior to leaving for field work that the SPOT is charged, that you have approporate cables, and that the unit(s) are in working order. Fieldwork Figure 10: Andrew in the Albertan boreal. IRSS lab field work is diverse and often different by project. Field work locations vary from very accessible (hotels and driving directly to field sites), to off the grid camping. Field work is a great opportunity to get to know your fellow lab mates and their projects, as well as explore parts of the country you might not normally get to see. Typically when the need for field work arises, Nicholas or the student will send a lab wide email with potential dates and the number of people needed. Students are encouraged to help on at least one field work campaign per year. Figure 11: Felix and Paul pruning some trees. When organizing field work, it is important to note what equipment you are planning to use, and to check it out via the Google Doc. Please ask Paul H. or Francois for access to the document when planning your field work. Field equipment is commonly demoed at the retreat, but additional training will also be provided by other students if needed. Some field equipment will need a sign off from Nicholas prior to being used. Figure 12: Sometimes the bugs can be bad. Figure 13: Sam Hillman (RMIT) measuring a transect in the Alex Fraser Research Forest. "],["working.html", "Working in the lab or from home Dogs in the lab policy", " Working in the lab or from home The lab has an alarm system that must be engaged at the end of the day by the last person out, and disengaged by the first person in. Its important to know how to use the alarm system. See the video \\\\frst-irsstor\\Root\\ByProject\\Orientation\\Orientation_Videos\\Alarm_Demo.mp4 to familiarize yourself. Prior to COVID-19, students were encouraged to be active members by coming into UBC each day. Students should limit spending large amounts of time working from home. With the advent of COVID and working from home we have seen the implications of not being around a dynamic and in-person lab, and as a result post COVID we intend to return to that requirement that all students come to UBC each day. We do appreciate however that each of you have different working styles with some students wishing to arrive early and leave early others may choose to arrive late and work late. That is fine with me and generally we could consider the hours between 10 - 2pm as being critical hours that everyone is around. Figure 14: The western lab room. With respect to taking days off during the week we appreciate that you may wish to take a day off occasionally during the week to reward yourself for a job well done or simply to enjoy outdoor activities without the rush of the weekend. You are welcome to do so as long as you recognize generally that that time would need to be made up, either through working on a weekend or extra hours during the week. For example, members of the lab have been known to take long weekends during the winter for skiing where they then make up the time lost by working a day on the following weekend. Figure 15: The western lab room. Figure 16: The eastern lab room. Dogs in the lab policy Figure 17: Notice used when dogs are in the lab. Dogs are allowed in the forestry building with documentation and approval. If you have a dog and are interested in bringing them in, you will need to apply through Joanne Dean from the FRM office - joanne.Dean@ubc.ca. The application involves basic information regarding the dog, as well as written approval from fellow lab members using a consent form. Once you have applied, you and the dog will be interviewed by Joanne. Provided there are no behavioral concerns, your dog will be issued a green collar to be worn in the lab, as well as a sign to say that there are dogs in the work place. It is important to note that while dogs are allowed, appropriate training is important. Too many dogs at once can be distracting, and a limit of 3 dogs across the IRSS rooms is enforced. Its therefore important to coordinate with other dog owners in the lab. Figure 18: Piotr commanding the attention of Tycho, Kyra, and Mocha. "],["social.html", "Social activities The retreat Holidays", " Social activities Figure 19: An ecstatic Nicholas at the BC ferries buffet - A retreat ritual. As a lab we have a variety of social events which are undertaken throughout the year. While some are spontaneous there are some other social events that we all do as a lab that have become tradition. The most important is the celebration following the defense of a Masters or PhD thesis. On the day of the defense we always go out for dinner and celebrate the accomplishment. The defending student picks the location where we go to eat, and through coordination with the IRSS social coordinator (currently Francois), we make a booking and celebrate the achievement. Typically an attendance poll is sent out prior to the event, and depending on space significant others can also join. Figure 20: Pizza and science - is there a better combo? We also have a number of other social activities throughout the year. Events that have occurred on a routine basis for a number of years include: Summer barbecue A brewery tour in East Vancouver often held in the fall An indoor board games day at Stormcrow which is held in the winter The IRSS Christmas party, hosted by Nicholas in early December Figure 21: Summer BBQ shenanigans. These events are inclusive to everyone and are done to allow students and staff to be better acquainted with one another. There is never any obligation to drink at these events and we encourage you to come for as long as you like. The retreat One of the major IRSS events throughout the year is the retreat. The IRSS retreat is generally in the first week of June of each year and involves travelling to a BC Ministry of Forests conference facility at Cowichan Lake on Vancouver Island. The retreat begins on Monday morning where we all leave together from Vancouver and traditionally we return on Thursday afternoon or Friday, if the retreat is 5 days. During the retreat we often have guest speakers, breakout groups, tips and tricks sessions, 3 minute thesis style presentations by students and post-docs, and lots of free time to discuss science and enjoy each others company. It also provides an opportunity for new students to meet and socialize with the rest of the lab in a relaxed setting. Information about transportation, speaking expectations and so on, are discussed in May prior to the prior to the retreat in June. Figure 22: A relaxing game of kubb beside Lake Cowichan. Figure 23: Cam gives a bear safety presentation. Holidays In general there are no set rules around the amount of time that students can take off for holidays per year. We are flexible in this regard and appreciate that many of us are away from family and friends and as a result may take longer holidays at different times of the year to return home. As your stipend and project time is a fixed length, any time spent on holiday is time not spent on your project so it requires self determination around the most appropriate timing and time to take off. I strongly recognize that however that holidays are also critically important to de-stress and so we strongly encourage students to take the holidays when they need and would like to. UBC is considered closed between Christmas and New Year. That week is not regarded as being part of any holiday considerations, you should always take that time off. If you do wish to take holidays, speak to Nicholas prior to discuss the implications of that time off, deadlines and so forth. Once discussed and jointly approved you can then take the appropriate holidays. Please avoid booking time off in the first week of June - this is almost always when the retreat occurs and it is mandatory to attend. The second most important lab event is the Christmas party. Nicholas will give as much notice as possible, but please avoid booking before the party if possible. "],["vehicle.html", "The lab vehicle Parking In case of an accident Returning from field work", " The lab vehicle Figure 24: The Nissan Xterra. Credit: Nissan The IRSS lab has access to a lab vehicle known as the Lab Truck. This vehicle is a Nissan Xterra 4 wheel drive which is available for students to use for field work. Within the lab we have a designated lab truck manager who is responsible for the maintenance and the booking of the vehicle. If you require the use of the vehicle for your field work, contact the lab manager to book the vehicle for your field work times. After each use of the lab truck you must log your kilometers using the Lab Truck Submission Form The vehicle itself is owned and managed by UBC. Gas can be put in the vehicle using the gas VISA card which remains in the glovebox compartment. You can only use the gas VISA card at registered service stations or gas stations. You cannot buy gas from non service stations e.g. 7/11. You must always keep the receipt for the gas as it needs to be reconciled against the visa statement each month. Please return the gas card and the receipt to the envelope in the glove box. The lab truck must always be used for UBC business. The mileage on the lab truck is calculated each month and the respective research accounts for our projects are then billed by the mileage which is undertaken. There are two sets of keys for the lab truck, both in the printer room (located in FSC room 2231). Please ensure you only take one set of keys when using the vehicle. The pass to open the UBC parking garage gate is in the truck in the center console between the two seats attached to a pizza menu. Always leave the pass in the truck. Parking The vehicle can be parked in two locations. There is a designated spot for the vehicle in the forestry basement parkade (labeled IRSS). In addition it is possible to park the vehicle at UBC Thunderbird parkade in the designated spot (R224 on the ground floor). If the vehicle is parked anywhere else at UBC it will incur a parking fine which the person driving the car at the time must pay. In case of an accident Should you get into an accident while using the vehicle, the registration papers for the vehicle are in the glove box. You are fully insured as a UBC student to drive the vehicle so you can provide your name and address, Nicholas name and phone number, and vehicle registration information to any police or other people involved in the accident. You should let Nicholas know immediately, regardless of the time of day, and UBC will then become involved with ICBC. Figure 25: Getting stuck can happen! Be prepared to get yourself out. Returning from field work You should always leave the truck as you found it (or cleaner)! Upon returning from any field work you should discuss the condition of the vehicle with the lab truck manager. If the vehicle has had or requires servicing (e.g. warning lights have gone on the dashboard) please immediately tell the lab track manager so we can ensure it gets serviced in a timely manner. If you returned from field work late, you are able to park the lab truck at home and bring it back to UBC the next day. The truck can be used in exceptional circumstances on the weekend, for example to help with moving or purchasing of lab supplies. Figure 26: A job well done and ready to come home.

Search previous students theses here Completion timeline Funding availability is the primary driver of your completion timeline. This can vary from student to student so its important be talk with Nicholas about your funding situation. MSc students typically get two years of funding; the goal is to complete your degree in that time, but this is not a hard rule. Around the two year mark, Nicholas will have a conversation about when you are going to finish. If it takes you an extra month or two Nicholas will continue paying your stipend, given you have shown consistent efforts to finish. PhD students get four years of funding. The goal is to complete your comprehensive exam before you finish your second year, and defend in your fourth year. Again, Nicholas will likely have a conversation with you when you get close to the fourth year mark. Figure 27: Agatha immediately after her recent successful defence. Congrats, Agatha! Publishing Nicholas encourages you to write academic papers about the components of your thesis project - these will basically become your thesis chapters (&amp; parts of other sections). The goal is 2 for MSc and 4 for PhD. More often than not students defend before they have published their 2nd or 4th paper. Nicholas addresses writing papers in the mini-proposal and mini-to-full proposal videos. Conferences Nicholas typically funds 1 conference for MSc students and 2 conferences for PhD students. Examples include: Canadian Remote Sensing Symposium - vast topics in remote sensing research across Canada (located in various cities across Canada) ForestSAT - spatial analysis and remote sensing technologies for forest monitoring, modeling &amp; description (international) Silvilaser - LiDAR focused (international) WHISPERS - Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (international) These conferences are a great opporunity to meet other scientists in your field, learn about their work, present your own, and make opportunities for collaboration.

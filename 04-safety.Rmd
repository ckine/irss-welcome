## In the lab {-#labsafety}

When you arrive at UBC you are given a safety orientation folder by the department. This  safety orientation folder contains a number of forms that need to be completed once you've arrived at UBC. There is a basic form which has your next of kin information, so UBC knows who to contact should that be necessary. This  also includes information such as allergies and medical conditions.There  is a basic office safety form which covers things like hazards in the office, correct ergonomics which  you also can read and complete once you've arrived at UBC you can also talk to Nicholas about your preferred working environment conditions, for example having access to a stand up desk and mat compared to a chair.

Within the IRSS lab itself we have two first aid kits: one in each room. Should an evacuation be required from the building the siren will sound and you must immediately evacuate the lab, shutting doors as you leave. The [gathering area for the forestry building](https://goo.gl/maps/SdDQTUNoT2ibtxkE8) is on the other side of Agronomy Road to the North of the forestry building itself.

## In the field {-#fieldsafety}

Prior to going out and doing field work for your project you will need to complete a safety plan. This involves filling out specific forms, providing important contact details, and outlining how you will keep yourself and your crew mates safe during your work.

### Forms {-#safetyforms}
There are a number of forms in relation to field work safety. In the IRSS lab because our field work is so diverse and often different by project, we do not have a universal field work safety form. What we do is prepare individual safety forms for each field trip tailored to the location and type of data being collected. Examples of these field safety sheets are in the orientation folder. As part of a field safety plan you need to provide information on your desired route, mileage, and accommodation including hotel name. You will also need to provide contact information and check-in procedures for how you will contact the lab either through cell phone check in or using the SPOT device (see below for more detail).

As part of this safety plan for each individual field work program you should consider what additional safety training is needed. We encourage all lab members to have basic first aid training which UBC will cover. We normally undertake lab training for first aid once per year. Other field work training, for example Bear AWARE might be needed depending on your field work location. It is critical this field work form is completed well in advance before departing into the field and the form is then signed by Nicholas and he maintains a copy whilst the field work is underway. Contact information is also provided on that form for next of kin and other people who may need to be contacted should something happen

### Communication {-#safetycomms}

For safety we have two [SPOT communicator units](https://www.findmespot.com/en-us/). These are for field work when you are out of cell phone coverage and they allow messages to be sent by satellite to designated users as well as having an SOS and help buttons for immediate police and search and rescue. The people who receive messages from the SPOT unit are set up using the SPOT website which Nicholas has access to. As a result, prior to using the units you need to log on to the website and change the appropriate contact people including their emails and phone numbers. This should be done prior to leaving for field work to ensure that when you check in the messages go to the right people. Please ensure prior to leaving for field work that the SPOT is charged, that you have approporate cables, and that the unit(s) are in working order.

## Fieldwork {-#fieldwork}

IRSS lab field work is diverse and often different by project. Field work locations vary from very accessible (hotels and driving directly to field sites), to ‘off the grid’ camping. Field work is a great opportunity to get to know your fellow lab mates and their projects, as well as explore parts of the country you might not normally get to see. Typically when the need for field work arises, Nicholas or the student will send a lab wide email with potential dates and the number of people needed. Students are encouraged to help on at least one field work campaign per year.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%",fig.align = 'center',fig.cap="Felix and Paul pruning some trees."}

```

When organizing field work, it is important to note what equipment you are planning to use, and to check it out via the Google Doc. Please ask Paul H. of Francois for access to the document when planning your field work. Field equipment is commonly demoed at the retreat, but additional training will also be provided by other students if needed. Some field equipment will need a sign off from Nicholas prior to being used.
